# Why Precision Rectifiers?

In normal rectifiers using diodes, the forward voltage drop (~0.7 V for silicon, ~0.3 V for Schottky) causes distortion when working with very small input signals (say, in mV range).
ðŸ‘‰ This makes normal rectifiers unsuitable for low-signal applications like audio processing, instrumentation, and AC voltmeters.

A precision rectifier overcomes this by using an op-amp + diode combination. The op-amp ensures that even tiny voltages get rectified correctly, eliminating the threshold issue.
